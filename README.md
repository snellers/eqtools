## eqtools

Various utility scripts related to the game of EverQuest.
- `countspells`: creates a report of a player's entire inventory. Very useful
  if you're playing an old version of the game where there's no inventory search.
- `rrscrape-py` (python edition): for raiding guilds that use guildlaunch.com to track raid attendance
  and loot distribution.
- `rrscrape` (perl edition): an earlier version of that script, written in perl. It does the same thing.
