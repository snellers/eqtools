### Python Setup

To use the Python scripts in this repo on Windows:

- Install miniconda https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#installing
- From the Windows task bar, launch Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)

This will give you an environment where python3 is in your path.

If you're already using another terminal emulator that you prefer
such as Cmder or Windows Powershell,
edit its settings and add %USERPROFILE%\miniconda3 to the PATH.
