## eqtools

Various utility scripts related to the game of EverQuest.
- countspells: creates a report of a player's entire inventory. Very useful
  if you're playing an old version of the game where there's no inventory search.
- rrscrape: for raiding guilds that use guildlaunch.com to track raid attendance
  and loot distribution.
